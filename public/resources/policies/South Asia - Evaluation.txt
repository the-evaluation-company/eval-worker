Policy 2: General Evaluation (US Equivalency)

Goal:

To determine the US educational equivalency of secondary and higher education credentials from Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India, based on the output of the Credential and Field Detection Policy. This policy uses the extracted data to apply specific equivalency rules.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: When applying this policy, ALWAYS replace any placeholders like "[Major]", "[insert exact Major from credential]", etc. with the SPECIFIC value from the credential being evaluated (e.g., "Chemistry", "Computer Science", etc.). Never include bracketed placeholders in your final output.

Equivalency: The US high school grade level, diploma, or degree equivalent.

Accredited Senior High School: For General Evaluation, if a recognized board issues a secondary document, the underlying school is considered "accredited."

Evaluation Rules:

Input: A list of document data objects, filtered to include only those with DocumentType = University-Issued. This includes documents with the AttestationFlag.

Standard Credit Hour Conversion: Assume 1 year of full-time study in the source country = 30 US semester credits. Prorate partial years. This assumption must be stated in the output.

Bachelor's Degree Equivalency:

4-Year Bachelor's (BD or BAD):

IF a document with DocumentCode = BD or BAD AND Duration >= 4 years AND IssuingUniversityRecognized = True:

THEN Equivalency = "Bachelor's Degree in [Major] from a regionally accredited institution of higher education"

AND Stop further processing.

3-Year Bachelor's (BD or BAD):

IF a document with DocumentCode = BD or BAD AND Duration = 3 years AND IssuingUniversityRecognized = True:

THEN Equivalency = "Completion of three years of undergraduate study in [insert exact Major from credential] from a regionally accredited institution of higher education"

AND Stop further processing.

Other Durations:

IF Duration < 3 or Duration is unclear:

THEN Return an ERROR: "INSUFFICIENT_DURATION_FOR_BACHELOR".

Master's Degree Equivalency (Combined with Bachelor's):

For South Asian credentials, pay special attention to the combined credential rules (e.g., "3-Year Bachelor's + Master's" scenarios)

Prerequisite: Bachelor's degree information must be available (either from a separate document or inferred from the Master's transcript).

3-Year Bachelor's + Master's (Same Field):

IF a 3-year Bachelor's (Equivalency as determined above) AND a document with DocumentCode = MD or MAD AND "same field" determination = "same field":

THEN Equivalency = "Bachelor of Science in [insert exact Major from credential] and a Master of Science in [insert exact Major from credential] from a regionally accredited institution of higher education"

3-Year Bachelor's + Master's (Different Fields):

IF a 3-year Bachelor's (Equivalency as determined above) AND a document with DocumentCode = MD or MAD AND "same field" determination = "different field":

THEN Equivalency = "Bachelor's Degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education"

3-Year Bachelor's + 1 Year of Master's (Same Field):

IF there is an equivalency for a 3-year Bachelor's and there are MD/MAD transcripts that state the student has completed 1 year (or 30 credits) AND IssuingUniversityRecognized = True AND "same field" determination = "same field":

THEN Equivalency = "Bachelor of Science in [insert exact Major from credential] from a regionally accredited institution of higher education"

3-Year Bachelor's + 1 Year of Master's (Different Fields):

IF there is an equivalency for a 3-year Bachelor's and there are MD/MAD transcripts that state the student has completed 1 year (or 30 credits) AND IssuingUniversityRecognized = True AND "same field" determination = "different field":

THEN Equivalency = "three years (90 US semester credits) of undergraduate study in [insert exact Major from Bachelor's credential] and one year (30 US semester credits) of undergraduate study in [insert exact Major from Master's credential] from a regionally accredited institution of higher education"

4-Year Bachelor's + Master's:

IF a 4-year Bachelor's (Equivalency as determined above) AND a document with DocumentCode = MD or MAD AND "same field" determination = "different field":

THEN Equivalency = "Bachelor of Science in [insert exact Major from Bachelor's credential] and Master of Science in [insert exact Major from Master's credential] from a regionally accredited institution of higher education"

AND Stop further processing.

IF a 4-year Bachelor's (Equivalency as determined above) AND a document with DocumentCode = MD or MAD AND "same field" determination = "same field":

THEN Equivalency = "Master of Science in [insert exact Major from Master's credential] from a regionally accredited institution of higher education"

AND Stop further processing.


Other Scenarios, Unclear Information:

IF none of the above rules apply due to insufficient or unclear information:

THEN Return an ERROR: "INSUFFICIENT_DOCUMENTS_FOR_EQUIVALENCY".

Output:

Equivalency: The US equivalency statement (string).

Major: The major field of study (string, may be blank).

SupportingDocuments: A list of the DocumentCode values of the documents used to determine the equivalency.

Assumptions: "This evaluation assumes that one year of full-time study in [Country] is equivalent to 30 US semester credits."

Recognized: "The [Name of University] is recognized by [Name of Accreditation Body]"

Errors: Any error codes encountered.

FieldofStudyComparison: Results and confidence.

Implementation Notes:

Dependency on Policy 1: This policy relies entirely on the accurate output of Policy 1.

Prioritized Rules: The rules are strictly prioritized. Once a rule matches, the process stops.

Error Handling: Use the error codes from Policy 1, and add "INSUFFICIENT_DOCUMENTS_FOR_EQUIVALENCY" as needed.

Clear Output: The output should be a concise, unambiguous statement of equivalency, along with the supporting information.

Field of Study Comparison Logic: This is the most complex piece of logic. The combination of keyword matching, course title comparison, and a pre-defined list of related fields should be carefully implemented and tested.

Regular Updates: Keep the databases in sync

Audit Trail: The AI must maintain a clear audit trail of its decisions, including the documents used, the rules applied, the credit hour conversion, and the same field determination details.

1. Goal
To establish consistent standards for preparing secondary-level credential evaluations, including course-by-course analysis and Carnegie unit assignment, for applicants from Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India. This policy details how to handle various combinations of board-issued and school-issued documents to determine U.S. equivalencies and document course content, including instances of partial final year study.

2. Definitions
Board-Issued Document: Official certificate, marks sheet, or transcript issued by a recognized national or regional examination board (e.g., CBSE, BISE, HSEB/NEB). These are the primary basis for establishing major credentials and equivalencies.

B10: Board-Issued Year 10 / Standard X document.

B12: Board-Issued Year 12 / Standard XII document.

School-Issued Document: Mark sheets, transcripts, or report cards issued directly by the secondary school attended by the student. These primarily provide supplementary detail for course analysis.

S9: School-Issued Year 9 / Standard IX document.

S11: School-Issued Year 11 / Standard XI document.

S12: School-Issued Year 12 / Standard XII document.

Partial Year Documentation (School-Issued): Refers to school-issued mark sheets or reports (S9, S11, S12) covering only a portion of an academic year (e.g., mid-term, terminal exams, first semester) without final annual results for that grade level.

Complete Year Documentation (School-Issued): Refers to school-issued mark sheets or reports (S9, S11, S12) covering the entire academic year, typically culminating in annual examination results.

Year/Standard: The grade level in the student's home country educational system.

Equivalency: The assessed U.S. educational equivalent (e.g., "Completion of 10th grade," "Diploma," "Partial completion of 12th grade").

Course Analysis: The process of listing individual subjects, grades, and assigned U.S. credits (Carnegie units) based on the provided documents.

Carnegie Unit: A measure of U.S. high school credit, typically representing 120 hours of class contact time over a year.

Credential: A distinct educational achievement documented in the evaluation report (e.g., Credential I for Year 10, Credential II for Year 12).

Accredited Senior High School: For the purpose of this policy, completion of studies leading to a B10 or B12 document, or documented school attendance at these levels, is considered to be from an institution comparable to an accredited U.S. senior high school.

3. Minimum Document Requirements for Board-Level Equivalency

4. Evaluation Scenarios based on Submitted Documents
(Apply the FIRST matching scenario based on the combination of documents received. Highest board document generally takes precedence for overall equivalency.)

Scenario 0: S11 OR partial S12 ONLY, no B10 or B12

Equivalency determination options are "Completion of 11th grade..." (highest fully completed), "Partial completion of 12th grade..." (most accurate). Defaulting to the highest fully documented level ("Completion of 11th grade...") is often preferred for simplicity unless otherwise specified.

ELSE IF only lower documents (S9, S11 only): THEN Return appropriate statement like "Completion of [X]th grade from an accredited senior high school"  where X is based on highest completed year.

Reveiew specialNotes if any to find out if the student finished the program or is still in progress.

5. Overarching Principles & Additional Rules

Primacy of Board Documents: B10 and B12 are required for "Completion of 10th grade" and "Diploma" equivalencies, respectively.

Use of School Documents: Use available S9, S11, S12 for detailed course analysis of the corresponding US grade level (9th, 11th, 12th). If school documents for a year covered by a board document are missing, use the board document for analysis of that period (e.g., B10 covers US 9th & 10th if S9 is missing; B12 covers US 11th & 12th if S11/S12 are missing).

Partial Final Year: School-issued documents showing partial completion of Year 12 (S12) without a B12 lead to a "Partial completion of 12th grade" equivalency (Scenario 7), not a diploma.

Credential Creation: Generally create credentials based on B10 and B12. School-based credentials (S9 only, S11 only, S11+partial S12) are created primarily when they represent the highest level documented and the corresponding board exam was not completed/submitted.

Board Documents Listing Multiple Years: If B10 explicitly details Year 9, or B12 explicitly details Year 11, use that breakdown within the board credential analysis. In such cases, the board document detail takes precedence over separate S9/S11 documents for course listing, though school docs can still inform grade interpretation if needed.

Length of Program (LoP): State accurately based on credentials. If both B10(I) and B12(II) are present, LoP is 10 years for I and 2 years beyond 10 for II. If only B12 is present, LoP is 12 years. Adjust for partial years per Scenario 7.
